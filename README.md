# Website Preview:

# About:
The backend for the site is not created (yet). I made a mock for this website for a local carwash business Premier Auto Spa based in Pasadena, CA. 
They were looking to revamp their website with a more modern approach to design and overall eye candy. 
It was a pleasure to make this for them and I can't wait to implement the back end and hopefully get more freelance opportunities.

# Future Implementation:
- Square API for bookings
- Google maps API for location
- Fully Reponsive on every page
- Nodejs Backend
